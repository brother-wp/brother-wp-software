- tetris-img.zip: a compressed disk image of Brother Tetris for the LW-30. This
  needs to be written to a 240kB 3.5" disk using GCR encoding.

- tetris-files.zip: the contents of the above disk image, extracted to files
  for ease of use.

- lw30-rom.zip: the main 256kB ROM from a LW-30. This was read with an EPROM
  programmer and so it doesn't include the remappings done by the ASIC. It also
  doesn't include the dictionary ROMs.
