Brother Word Processor Software

# WP-2450 DS and WP-2410 DS
The Brother WP-2450 DS software also appears to work on the WP-2410 DS.


Note: I suspect that this is missing a disk or program that runs/opens the encyclopedia software, as I have not found a way to open the files on the encyclopedia disks yet.

# PN-8500MDSe
The Brother Super PowerNote PN-8500MDSe Software was found and extraced from a blog article on [ToughDev.com](http://www.toughdev.com/content/2016/06/brother-super-powernote-pn-8500mdse-vintage-word-processor/).

# LW-30
The LW-30 is a GCR-disk, LCD-screen model which is probably the
German/French/Swiss version of the WP-1400D.

# WP-1
This looks like an early GCR-disk, glass-screen model, but it uses the 240kB
GCR format rather than the 120kB format, so it may actually be later.
